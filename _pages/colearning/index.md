# Co-learning Community

## What Is It?

Lectures are a bit boring (okay, not all, but quite a number of them are). We understand that and are offering a new approach to that where **each co-learner takes ownership of their own learning.** We also understand that real learning does not happen if you have not applied what you learnt. Hence, every session will end with a **mini-project** that illustrates what you have learnt.

You will personally check a list of concepts and ensure that you have applied it. Fellow members in their co-learning groups will take turns to check each others' work and provide feedback. The more feedback you provide, the more everyone learns. This is our **projects driven, co-learning** approach.

While we understand that there is plenty of buzz about Deep Learning, Machine Learning, etc, we emphasize that we are largely **fundamentals driven.** Our belief is that by focusing too much on the buzz, you miss the fundamentals. By missing these fundamentals, you're literally building your future in analytics on shaky foundations. You will fall. 

As self-learners ourselves, by focusing on the fundamentals, we ensure that we are less susceptible to shifting trends in the analytics landscape. Trained on strong foundations, nothing will phase us.

## Objectives & Outcomes

When you have finished this programme, you should expect to have a portfolio of mini-projects and one, final project to use for your Summer Analytics Internship application(s).

The mini-projects are designed to show that you have synthesized the topics and concepts for that particular learning session.

The final project is designed to show that you have the ability to (non-exhaustive):
- work on a team
- apply project management skills
- use git for file management
- build and use the necessary models
- come up with the right data-driven questions

# Rules

## Why these rules?

It's designed to help us build an awesome, productive and fearless community. It's not designed to burden you.

### 1. No feigning surprise

Don't act surprised when someone says they don't know something. It has no educational benefit. It may make you feel better, but at the expense of others. While there's no immediate harm, it's obstructing a culture that embraces not knowing something and seeking answers for those things.

### 2. No half-hearted explanations

Don't simply give a half-hearted explanation of something you know, which others do not know. You may know how something works, but if you can't really explain it in simple terms, are you sure you really know you know it well enough? Humble yourself and treat each genuine question from others as an opportunity to improve your understanding. More importantly, we help each other :).

### 3. No back-seat driving

Let's say someone is trying to solve a problem. Do not sporadically (at random intervals) offer advice. If you wish to help, put your heart into it and commit to it. We're not saying you shouldn't try to help. Rather, you should fully engage in it. It would immensely help the other party as well.

### 4. No subtle-isms

Don't be sarcastic. It doesn't help with learning. If you have something to share, speak directly and in a clear manner. Always make others feel comfortable and encouraged to ask questions, learn from each other.
