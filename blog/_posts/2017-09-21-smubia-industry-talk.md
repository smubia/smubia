Following SMUBIA’s success at SMU VIVACE just less than a month before, SMUBIA conducted its inaugural industry talk session on the evening of 6 September 2017. Addressing a packed seminar room of just over 80 SMUBIA members, are an esteemed speaker line-up:


**1.** Juan Kanggrawan, Assistant Director (Corporate & Business Development), Sense Infosys

**2.** Sutayasa, International Outsourcing Manager, PayPal International Headquarter

**3.** Victor & Amos, Consultants for FactSet


The session opened with a brief sharing by Sutasaya, covering the fundamentals of applying analytics in the finance sector, highlighting the importance of defining the desired business outcome before beginning work on crunching the data. 

Riding on the momentum are Victor and Amos, who shared about FactSet’s analytics platform and the value add to the private and institutional investors the 70 Billion dollar company serves. Offering much more than familiar market intelligence platforms like S&P’s CapitalIQ & Bloomberg, FactSet not only analyses fundamentals from portfolio companies, but also drives insights from these companies’ upstream and downstream.

Juan Kanggrawan concluded the keynote sharing with a demo of Sense Infosys’ Qlik platform, emphasising the importance of distilling complex data insights to actionable roadmaps that business decision makers could consider. 

The session concluded with a short panel QnA. Questions relating to analytics skillsets and career we development were addressed by the panel, and gears quickly changed as Suta shared about the role of analytics in his domain of payments governance, while Juan shared from his personal experience, some tips to enhance communication outcomes with business stakeholders as an analytics practitioner.

The session concluded with a group photo taking and networking.
