This session touches on linear regression for the ML Track and XXX for the data visualization track. Basics of linear regression, its formula and how to interpret the output in python was taught for the ML Track. For the data visualization track, .... was taught.

***Note:*** *Our Data Associates Program is split into 2 tracks for Semester 2 '18. They are: (1) Machine Learning and (2) Data Visualization. Sessions are on a weekly basis, except for special occasions.*

## Machine Learning Track

> The DAP session was a useful session as it helped us to better understand the application of Python to run regressions and machine learning. For the homework, my partners and I ran a regression to see if weight had any correlation with the scoring of ratings. We hypothesized that if you're heavier (assuming due to eating more), you'd be more strict with the ratings given since you've tasted more food. We found that weight had no correlation with ratings given.

The session began with the sharing of the homework done by our associate for the previous session. To quickly recap, the previous session covered Exploratory Data Analysis using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [plotly](https://plot.ly/), [matplotib](https://matplotlib.org/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). Our associates for this track were tasked with forming teams of 2-3 people to explore the data set provided in our [open source repository](https://github.com/smubia/dap-2017/tree/master/Sem%202%20-%20Data%20Specializations/Visualizations/restaurant-data-with-consumer-ratings)

A list of homework shared by the associates are listed below:
1. [Shaun Lai, Minquan and Darren](https://github.com/minquan94/BIA-Assignment-Yeow-Min-Quan)
2. [Shubham Periwal](https://github.com/shubhamperiwal/Visualisations
)
3. [Gabriel Chuan](https://github.com/gczh/DAP-Portfolio/blob/master/Assignment 1 - Data Exploration.ipynb)

It was exciting to see the associates sharing their homework, highlighting what they have put into practice from what was learnt in the previous session.

Tze Yiing covered the basics of linear regression with heavy references from [Andrew Ng's machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) as well as [Introduction to Statistical Learning in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).



## Data Visualization Track

> The session allowed us to think about the types of questions or concerns we ought to bear in mind when creating visualisations. That there is a alot of stakeholders involved before, during and after creating a visualization.
